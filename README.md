# labbook

A [pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/) theme for a simple scientific labbook.

## Notes

- Default index page shows all articles, grouped into categories.
- 'By date' page shows all articles sorted by date.
    - This requires `"everything"` to be in `DIRECT_TEMPLATES` in your `pelicanconf.py`.
- Tags currently not implemented.
